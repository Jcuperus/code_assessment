# Automatic code assessment
A Django app intended to automatically let students assess their code assignments using static code analysis tools for PHP. It lets you add the results from multiple tools together by extending the CliToolWrapper class to implement analysis tools. This project only supports the PHP code sniffer and PHP mess detector tools.
